Reference: Xbee 900HB Manual: ftp://ftp1.digi.com/support/documentation/90002173_B.pdf

Bee bootloader project

PYTHON
- maximum packet size with Xbee 900HB is 256. Expressed as global variable in Xbee.py
- refactor things so that escape bits are used (Arduino Xbee library requires escape characters so that way we match it)
  - page 57 in documentation

  
  
BOOTLOADER
- needs to parse firmware code from multiple packets


API Specifications

Any packet will have this kind of prefix:

| START DELIMITER (0x7E) | LENGTH (MSB) | LENGTH (LSB)     | FRAME TYPE (TRANSMIT=0x10) | FRAME ID (want ACK) | 
|:----------------------:|:------------:|:----------------:|:--------------------------:|:-------------------:|
|           0            |      1       |        2         |            3               |          4          |


Then, there is the actual API frame.

Finally, there is the suffix of the checksum. In python, checksum can be calcualted: `(0xFF-sum(i[3:-1])&255)`

Note that the API mode we are using implement escape bytes so that we can be compatible with the Xbee-Arduino library.
Here is the relevant documentation:

Data bytes that need to be escaped:
• 0x7E – Frame Delimiter
• 0x7D – Escape
• 0x11 – XON
• 0x13 – XOFF

Example -
Raw serial data frame (before escaping interfering bytes):
0x7E 0x00 0x02 0x23 0x11 0xCB

0x11 needs to be escaped which results in the following frame:
0x7E 0x00 0x02 0x23 0x7D 0x31 0xCB

Note: In the above example, the length of the raw data (excluding the checksum) is 0x0002 and the checksum of the non-escaped data (excluding frame delimiter and length) is calculated as:
0xFF - (0x23 + 0x11) = (0xFF - 0x34) = 0xCB
